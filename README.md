Hey, how you doing? 😄

> Who am I? 🧐

I'm Natanael Oliveira, or just Natan!
Currently I'm doing my master's degree in Astronomy/Astrophysics, working on the dark matter distribution in Milky Way analog galaxies.

> What do I like to do? ✨🏐🏊🏼

Intrinsically I'm a geek, so I love programming, reading, and... well, I really appreciate playing sports (e.g. volleyball, football, hiking, swimming and everything else >.<). I also love to cook and talk about science (not necessarily astronomy!), history, artificial intelligence and stuff!

> What are my areas of scientific interest? 🧑🏼‍🚀👨🏻‍💻

My areas of interest are Extragalactic Astrophysics and Cosmology, focusing especially on dark matter haloes and their co-evolution with the host galaxy over the cosmic time.

Here, on GitHub, you can find some of the codes I've made. You can find codes about data cube reduction and analysis, extraction of galaxy rotation curves from the flux and velocity maps and stuff.
